# MyReads Project

![Image of App](/public/myreads.png)

* To Begin, Download the repository, then run `npm install` followed by `npm start`

* This Project I worked on the functionality of the application using a starter code given by [Udacity](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-myreads-starter). On the main page it contains three shelves : Currently Reading, Want to Read and Read. When you select a different shelf, the book will move there. You can also search for new books to add to your library.
